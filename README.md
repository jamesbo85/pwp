##Suggestions
- Explore gallery plugins. [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/)
- Take a look at Bootstrap's [Carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel), and [Navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar).
- Look into CSS3 animation effects for your hover states

###Milestone 4 Feedeback
 - let me know if you'd like some assistance getting a layout up and running. Let's simplify things and you can have a layout up in no time. I do have a few examples up on github and bootcamp-coders that you're free to look at and take snippets from. Also, if I can help with a layout, let me know.
